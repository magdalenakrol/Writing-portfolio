  The god's priests - harons - are six most powerful, richest and greediest figures in Hekkyran. Main character, young man named Kai, was born to inherit his haron's position - before his father exiled him in anger.

  After five yearsn Kai's father is lying in his deathbed, finally allowing his son to come back and claim his legacy of power and fortune.

  However, Kai has other ideas. Inspired by mysterious ancient rulebook titled "Code of Haron", he strives to make harons humble, modest and selfless servants of the people.
